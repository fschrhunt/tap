# tap releases

## Unreleased

- Brand assets: the tap logo, wordmark and lockup in black and white under `assets/`, and the
  lockup in the README header.
- Docs with examples in `docs/`: install and connecting each agent, servers and the config file,
  every command, and how tap works. The README is now a short overview.
- `TAP_DEADLINE_MS` overrides the 5 second per-server deadline; the test suite uses it and runs in
  seconds instead of nearly a minute.
- Prepare the first open-source release: two lazy MCP tools, five-second server
  deadlines with retries, quieter CLI commands, dot-free server names, and offline
  tests. Remove the `serve`, `mcp`, and `local` aliases.
